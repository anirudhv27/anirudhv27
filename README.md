### Hi, I'm Anirudh. Welcome to my Github profile! 

I am a second-year student at MIT studying electrical engineering and computer science (Course 6-2). 

I love solving problems that people face daily, from creating more efficient transportation systems that help us live in a cleaner future to developing a platform to find friends on campus. Here are a few standout personal projects that I've worked on:
- Socialyze: a social media platform where MIT students can find other people with similar interests.
- An AI-powered gesture-based system to control a car's interface using hand signals.
- Tango: an AI dance coach where users can learn choreo from any video of the user's choosing, providing real-time accuracy metrics and summary statstics.
- Mission Connected: a closed forum and management system that enables high school clubs to communicate with their members and streamlines the club discovery and approval process.

Aside from my personal endeavors, I am also fascinated by the application of automation to efficient systems. I am currently conducting intelligent infrastructure research at [Prof. Cathy Wu's Lab](http://www.wucathy.com/blog/) under the lab's AlphaDrive project, using computer vision to impute traffic inflow data at intersections with the goal of reducing carbon emissions.

Some of my hobbies include learning languages (I speak 5), hiking, and dancing for MIT's competitive Bollywood Team Mirchi, where I am in charge of the team's finances.
