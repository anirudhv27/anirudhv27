### Hi there! I am Anirudh.

Welcome to my Github profile! I am a second-year student at MIT studying electrical engineering and computer science (Course 6-2). 

I love solving problems that people face daily, from creating more efficient transportation systems that help us live in a cleaner future to developing a platform to find friends on campus. Here are a few standout personal projects that I've worked on:
- Socialyze: a social media platform where MIT students can find other people with similar interests.
- An AI-powered gesture-based system to control a car's interface using hand signals.
- Tango: an AI dance coach where users can learn choreo from any video of the user's choosing, providing real-time accuracy metrics and summary statstics.
- Mission Connected: a closed forum and management system that enables high school clubs to communicate with their members and streamlines the club discovery and approval process.

Aside from my personal endeavors, I am also fascinated by the application of automation to efficient systems. I am currently conducting intelligent infrastructure research at (Prof. Cathy Wu's Lab)[http://www.wucathy.com/blog/] under the lab's AlphaDrive project, using computer vision to impute traffic inflow data at intersections with the goal of reducing carbon emissions.
