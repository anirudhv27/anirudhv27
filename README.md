### Hi, I'm Anirudh. Welcome to my Github profile! 

I am a third-year student at MIT studying Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (Course 6-4). 

I love solving difficult and ever-present daily problems, from developing cutting-edge robotic manipulation systems with the power of generative AI to creating more efficient transportation systems that help us live in a cleaner future. Here are a few standout personal projects that I've worked on:
- AlphaDrive: A intelligent infrastructure research project in [Prof. Cathy Wu's Lab](http://www.wucathy.com/blog/), where I worked in imputing traffic inflow data at intersections for a downstream distributed RL model with the goal of reducing carbon emissions.
- Socialyze: a social media platform where MIT students can find other people with similar interests.
- An AI-powered gesture-based system to control a car's interface using hand signals.
- Tango: an AI dance coach where users can learn choreo from any video of the user's choosing, providing real-time accuracy metrics and summary statstics.
- Mission Connected: a closed forum and management system that enables high school clubs to communicate with their members and streamlines the club discovery and approval process.

Aside from my personal endeavors, I am also fascinated by the immense potential of recent advances in generative AI to enable embodied intelligence. As an undergraduate researcher (UROP) in the [Scene Representation Group](https://www.scenerepresentations.org/) and [Robot Locomotion Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/people.html), I am currently working on a research project exploring the applications of generative AI to solve the problem of generalizable robotic dextrous manipulation.

Some of my hobbies include learning languages (I speak 5), hiking, and dancing for MIT's competitive Bollywood Team Mirchi, where I am in charge of the team's finances.
